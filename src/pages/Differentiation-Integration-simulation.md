The goal is to teach calculus Integration and Differentiation topics using car displacement, velocity, and acceleration. As the car moves, the graphs of Displacement, velocity, and acceleration over time are drawn.

### Differentiation:

The graphs of velocity and acceleration illustrate the first and second derivatives of displacement, respectively. The velocity graph displays critical points (local minimum or maximum), and changes in concavity are shown using the second derivative.

### Integration:

The area below the velocity graph is used to demonstrate how integration works. The displacement graph shows the integral of the velocity graph.
